<p>Scott Adams, the author of Dilbert, <a href="https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/scott-adams-financial-advice/">outlined</a> a simple one-pager on general financial advice. The advice is straightforward, but let's break it down a little.

        <span class="fas fa-credit-card fa-sm"></span> Pay Off Your Credit Card
      </h5>
      <p class="card-text">Credit card balances usually carry double-digit interest rates. Since the balances have the highest interest rates of all debt that you're likely to accumulate, it's best to pay these off first.</p>

      </h5>
      <p class="card-text">If you have a family to support, purchase term life insurance. Although term life insurance has an end date, it's much cheaper and it's much easier to understand than permanent insurance.</p>

      </h5>

      </h5>
      <p class="card-text">Open an account at a discount brokerage and invest 70% of your remaining money in a low-cost stock index fund, and the other 30% in a low-cost bond fund. Do not touch this until retirement.</p>
